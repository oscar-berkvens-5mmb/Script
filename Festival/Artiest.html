      <p>Felix De Laet, better known by his moniker Lost Frequencies, has soared to success in the international music
        industry over the past half-decade. Releasing his global smash hit ‘Are You With Me’ back in 2014 with the track
        rapidly ascended by hitting multi-platinum status, taking the #1 spot in 18 countries and becoming the first
        Belgian artist to hit #1 in the UK. Proving that he is no one-trick pony in the studio, ‘Reality’ evidenced as
        another major smash hit from that, and flew to platinum status in no less than 7 territories, before the release
        of his debut album ‘Less Is More’ (2016), and sophomore follow-up ‘Alive And Feeling Fine’ (2019), showcased his
        enthusiasm, dedication to craft and sheer skill all whilst playing the long game. One of Lost Frequencies
        biggest success in recent memory has to be that of the unmistakeable distinction of ‘Where Are You Now’ that, as
        of 2022, saw him hit #1 on The Official Big Top 40, and Top 5 on the Official Charts in the UK, also peaking at
        #1 on the Shazam charts in 10 countries, with over 500 million combined streams as of February ‘22, earning
        further accolades such as BBC Radio 1’s ‘Track Of The Week’. Furthermore, ‘Where Are You Now’ has reached
        Platinum status across 8 territories, including 3x in Lost Frequencies home country of Belgium and hit the #1
        chart spot in Ireland, Poland and Slovakia – with no signs of slowing down.</p>
